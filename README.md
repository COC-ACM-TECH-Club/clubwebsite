### Get Started
1. [Install nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

2. Fork the repo and clone it in a directory
    - Refer to [github's forking guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) and follow each and every step to set up your fork.

3. Install npm packages and build the project in the `my-react-app` directory.
    - `cd clubwebsite\my-react-app` 
        > This changes your directory to `my-react-app`.
    - `npm install`, `npm build dev`
        > This installs various react dependencies and lets you build a preview of the project.
    
4. Open the link `http://localhost:[XXXX]/`.
    > `XXXX` is a randomized port chosen when building the project.
    - Now you can preview what the website will look like based on the code you write.
